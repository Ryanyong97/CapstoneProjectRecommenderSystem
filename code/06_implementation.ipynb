    "\n",
    "### 1. `summoner_names`\n",
    "This variable is a list of summoner names, where each name is a string formatted as `\"game name#tag name\"`. This format combines the player's in-game name with their associated tag in a single string.\n",
    "- **Example Usage**:\n",
    "  - `'Atrophy#Fiend'` represents a summoner with the game name \"Atrophy\" and the tag \"Fiend\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `account_region`\n",
    "Specifies the account region for the Riot Games API calls. This is necessary to target the correct regional database when fetching player-specific data.\n",
    "- **Example Values**:\n",
    "  - `'asia'`: Represents the Asian server region.\n",
    "  - For full list, reference 01a_data_scrape.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `summoner_region`\n",
    "Used to specify the game server region for summoner-related queries, which can differ from the account region.\n",
    "- **Example Value**:\n",
    "  - `'SG2'`: Represents the Singapore server region.\n",

    "## Champion Mastery Data Retrieval and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to retrieve and process champion mastery data for each summoner from the Riot Games API, and then format this data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps and Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `mastery_data`\n",
    "A dictionary initialized to store the champion masteries for each summoner. Each key in the dictionary represents a summoner's name, and the corresponding value is another dictionary mapping champion IDs to mastery points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Scrape Champion Masteries\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - For each summoner in the `summoner_names` list, the summoner's name is split into `game_name` and `tag_name`.\n",
    "  - The PUUID (Player Universally Unique Identifier) is retrieved using the `get_puuid()` function.\n",
    "  - Champion masteries are fetched using the `get_champion_masteries()` function, using the retrieved PUUID.\n",
    "  - Each summoner's mastery data is structured as a dictionary mapping from champion ID to the number of mastery points and stored in `mastery_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `users_df`\n",
    "- **Creation**:\n",
    "  - A DataFrame is created from `mastery_data` using `pd.DataFrame.from_dict()`, with summoners as rows and champion IDs as columns.\n",
    "- **Modification**:\n",
    "  - The DataFrame is oriented by index (`orient='index'`), meaning each row labels will be summoners' names.\n",
    "  - NaN values in the DataFrame are filled with 0 to represent no mastery points for certain champions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `champion_id_name_mapping`\n",
    "- A dictionary is created using `create_champion_id_name_mapping()` to map champion IDs to their names. This utilizes static data fetched from Data Dragon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Column Renaming in DataFrame\n",
    "- The columns of `users_df` are renamed according to `champion_id_name_mapping` to replace champion IDs with their names for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Displaying DataFrame\n",
    "- `users_df.head()` is used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame, showing a snippet of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "This script provides a detailed view of the champion mastery levels across multiple summoners, useful for analyzing patterns in champion preferences and mastery across different players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This script assumes the presence of external functions like `get_puuid()` and `get_champion_masteries()` and requires the `pandas` library for DataFrame operations. It also assumes the `riot_watcher` library setup with proper API keys.\n"

    "## Function `process_and_predict(dataframe)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function processes the input DataFrame by applying a series of transformations and scaling operations on the data (excluding a specific column 'rank'), and then uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Exclusion of 'rank' Column**:\n",
    "   - The function starts by excluding the 'rank' column from any transformations. This is to preserve the original rank data as it may be used as a label or for data stratification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Filling Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - The function fills any missing values in the DataFrame with 0 using `dataframe.fillna(0)`. This step ensures that there are no null values which might lead to errors during transformations or predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Log Transformation**:\n",
    "   - A log transformation (using `np.log1p`) is applied to the columns specified in `columns_to_transform`. This transformation is often used to reduce skewness of data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Scaling**:\n",
    "   - The data in `columns_to_transform` is then scaled using a predefined scaler (`scaler.transform`). This is typically done to normalize or standardize data before applying machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Dropping 'rank' for Prediction**:\n",
    "   - The 'rank' column is temporarily dropped for the purpose of making predictions, ensuring it does not influence the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Matrix Factorization Using SVD**:\n",
    "   - Singular Value Decomposition is applied on the transformed data to obtain user-specific matrices (`predicted_U`).\n",
    "   - These matrices are then used to calculate the predicted ratings by multiplying with the transpose of a matrix `Vt_k` to form the complete predicted matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Reinsert 'rank' Column**:\n",
    "   - After predictions, the 'rank' column is reinserted back into the predicted matrix to maintain the original structure of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Return Predicted DataFrame**:\n",
    "   - The function returns the DataFrame containing the predicted data along with the original 'rank' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming the DataFrame is read from a CSV file\n",
    "dataframe = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')\n",
    "predictions = process_and_predict(dataframe)\n",

    "## Function `hybrid_recommendation_with_rank(new_user_matrix, top_n=10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function provides a hybrid recommendation by integrating rank-based weighting with collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. It is designed to predict user preferences for \"champions\" in a gaming context, like League of Legends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Calculate Rank-Based Weights**:\n",
    "   - Extracts the 'rank' column from the training predicted matrix to determine the ranks of all existing users.\n",
    "   - Calculates two sets of weights:\n",
    "     - `primary_weights`: Linearly scaled based on the difference between the ranks of existing users and the new user.\n",
    "     - `secondary_weights`: Exponential decay based on the absolute difference, softening the impact of rank distance.\n",
    "   - Computes `total_weights` by multiplying primary and secondary weights, balancing the impact of both proximity and ranking disparity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Weight Collaborative Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Removes the 'rank' column from the training matrix to focus only on the collaborative prediction data.\n",
    "   - Multiplies the collaborative predictions by the `total_weights` to adjust the influence of each existing user based on their rank relative to the new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Aggregate Collaborative Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Takes the mean of the weighted predictions across all users to consolidate into a single predicted rating for each champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Calculate Cosine Similarity for Content-Based Filtering**:\n",
    "   - Drops the 'rank' column from the new user matrix.\n",
    "   - Computes the cosine similarity between the new user's preference vector and all others using a pre-existing champion similarity matrix, generating content-based scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Combine Collaborative and Content-Based Scores**:\n",
    "   - Adds the content-based scores to the collaborative predictions to form combined scores for each champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Sort and Select Top N Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Converts combined scores into a pandas Series for easier manipulation.\n",
    "   - Sorts the scores in descending order and selects the top `N` champions as recommended.\n",
    "\n",
